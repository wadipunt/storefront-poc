## **Bonus Free Spins Round**

The main attraction in Big Bass Splash is the bonus feature. It is triggered when 3, 4, or 5 fish scatters are in view, awarding you with 10, 15, or 20 free spins, respectively. Moreover, when you land two scatters in view simultaneously, another scatter symbol can randomly appear on the reels.

If it’s possible for two scatter to move down one position without tumbling off the grid, the reels without scatters will respin. At this stage of the bonus feature, a hook might pull one reel out of the grid, providing you with a chance of landing a third scatter.

When the free spins feature is activated, a fisherman can appear on any of the five reels. When in view, he substitutes for pay symbols to link winning combinations. If you land a wild at the same time as a fish symbol, the fisherman collects their cash value.

Should you land four wilds, you are presented with an additional ten free spins and a multiplier. If you have won any money with any fish symbols, the multiplier will be applied - it is worth x2, x3, and x10 for levels 2, 3, and 4, respectively. It isn’t possible to trigger free spins when you reach level 4.
